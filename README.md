# Basic Overview
The website's **Markup** is well-structured and optimized, with carefully chosen class and ID names that provide clear indications of their content. The responsive design ensures that the website adapts effectively to various screen sizes. Each component of the website is designed to match its intended functionality, creating a seamless user experience. Extensive research was conducted to select a theme that is visually appealing and easy on the eyes, enhancing the overall appeal of the application.

The **JavaScript** code handles user input, specifically the number of classes attended and missed. It updates the corresponding subjects in the attendance records and calculates the attendance percentage accordingly. Additionally, JavaScript interfaces with Java through the use of @JavascriptInterface, enabling the passing of data from the web app to Java for storage and retrieval purposes.

**Java** plays a crucial role in creating an Android web container with appropriate settings. It facilitates the establishment of a JavaScript interface and enables the storage of attendance records in data.json and detailedData.json files. Furthermore, Java facilitates the communication of data to JavaScript for further processing.
